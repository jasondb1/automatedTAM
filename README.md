# automatedTAM
A power automate for TAM's

Reactive email sort:

Some minimal configuration is required to work on your specific outlook folders.
I have marked the sections that require configuration and am happy to walk anyone through the configuration.

Step 1: Download the zip file - https://github.com/jasondb1/automatedTAM/raw/master/ProcessCustomerEmailV2.zip

Step 2: Go to https://www.office.com/ -> Power Automate -> My Flows

Step 3: Click the Import button and select the downloaded file

Step 4: During import connectors will be setup – (This has recently changed so I can’t specify exactly how you need to proceed here) as I import these into my existing environment likely you will need to specify ‘create new connectors’

Step 5: Edit the flow to Configure the options as required
